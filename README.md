# TLDiscover [![GPLv3 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://github.com/chrispetrou/TLDiscover/blob/master/LICENSE)

**TLDiscover** is a __multi-threaded__ _top-level-domain fuzzer._ 

```bash
$ ./tldiscover.py -h
usage: tldiscover.py [-h] -u  [-t] [-v] [-a] [-l] [-m] [--timeout]

TLDdiscover Top level domain discovery.

arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -u , --url       Specify a domain to start with.
  -t , --threads   Specify number of threads to use [default: None]
  -v, --verbose    Enable verbosity [default False]
  -a, --useragent  User a random user-agent [default False]
  -l, --log        Save the results in a log file [Default: False]
  -m, --map        Create a map [Default: False]
  --timeout        Specify HTTP connection timeout [default 10 sec]
  ```

The way it works can be best described by the following diagram:

<center><img src="images/new.png" width="80%"></center>

It starts with a _base url_ and then attempts to find all the other possible urls, __following redirects__ if needed. Actually it performs exactly like a normal browser following redirects but it's way faster. In this way it is possible to discover other domains or in some special cases even subdomains. In the process it also extracts some basic info (_the title if provided_) for each page. The domains may not be related with each other.

> __Warning:__ It doesn't check, at least in the currect version, if the urls discovered are safe and It's exclusively the end user's responsibility:
>*   to use this tool/software
>*   how to handle the information this software/tool provides.

### <u>Example</u>

When `--map/-m` option is specified then a map is also created with every domains that is able to be resolved, as shown below:

### TODO
- [ ] Check how safe a discovered website might be (_using probably google safe browsing update API_) or at least estimate if it is considered legit.
